 British Airways Data Science Job Simulation
 Project Overview

This project is based on the British Airways Data Science Job Simulation offered by Forage, where the objective is to apply data science and machine learning techniques to solve real-world airline business problems.

The project focuses on analyzing customer review data and predicting factors that influence customer buying behavior, helping the airline make data-driven strategic decisions related to customer satisfaction and service improvement.

 Business Objective

British Airways aims to:

Understand customer sentiment and behavior from review data

Identify key factors influencing booking and purchasing decisions

Use predictive modeling to support business decision-making

This simulation mirrors how data scientists work with real airline data to extract insights and build predictive models.

 Dataset Description

The project uses:

Customer review data collected from airline review platforms

Structured datasets containing customer attributes, ratings, and feedback

Data Characteristics:

Mixed features (numerical + categorical)

Customer experience and service-related variables

Real-world data challenges such as missing values and noise

 Tools & Technologies Used

Python

Pandas & NumPy – data cleaning and manipulation

Matplotlib & Seaborn – exploratory data analysis and visualization

Scikit-learn – machine learning models and evaluation

Jupyter Notebook – analysis and experimentation

GitHub – version control and documentation

 Methodology

The project follows an end-to-end data science workflow:

1️ Data Collection & Preparation

Loaded and inspected customer review datasets

Handled missing values and inconsistencies

Encoded categorical variables where required

2️ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed distribution of customer ratings and reviews

Identified key patterns and trends influencing customer behavior

Visualized relationships between variables using plots and charts

3️ Feature Engineering

Selected relevant predictors affecting customer purchase behavior

Prepared feature matrix suitable for machine learning models

4️ Predictive Modeling

Built supervised machine learning models to predict:

Customer buying behavior

Factors influencing purchase decisions

Applied classification techniques using scikit-learn

5️ Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using standard performance metrics:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix

 Key Insights

Customer purchasing decisions are influenced by service quality, experience ratings, and specific travel-related features

Machine learning models successfully captured patterns in customer behavior

Insights can be used to:

Improve targeted marketing strategies

Enhance customer experience

Support operational and service planning

 Future Improvements

Apply advanced NLP techniques on textual reviews

Use ensemble models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)

Perform hyperparameter tuning for better performance

Deploy the model using Flask/FastAPI for real-time predictions

Create a dashboard (Power BI / Streamlit) for business users
